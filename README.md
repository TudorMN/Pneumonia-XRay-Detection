# Pneumonia-XRay-Detection

Pneumonia detection by using Convolutional Neural Networks designed with the Keras library.

The project considers a binary classification approach:
- 0 (Pneumonia Absence)
- 1 (Pneumonia Existance)

Train data:
- Class 0 -> 1349 samples
- Class 1 -> 3883 samples

Test data:
- Class 0 -> 234 samples
- Class 1 -> 390 samples

Classification results obtained: 84.24%
